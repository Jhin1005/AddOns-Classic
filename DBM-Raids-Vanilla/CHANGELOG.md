# DBM - Vanilla and Season of Discovery

## [r779](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/tree/r779) (2025-02-11)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/compare/r778...r779) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/releases)

- Naxx/Loatheb: Fix voice for healer special warning  
- Naxx/Kel'Thuzad: Slight adjustment for SoD phase 1 timer  
- Naxx/Thaddius: Show health frame during phase 1  
- Naxx/HM: Attempt at potentially fixing/improving Military HM detection  
    I didn't end up being targeted even once by it, so no good logs  
- Naxx: Add trash mod  
- adjust 2 timer colors and add inline icons to geddon to creaste better distinction between bars  
- Remind players who have the bomb that they STILL have the bomb when baron Geddon dies  
- apparently it wasn't removed, just match sensitive now  
- remove group support  
- apply several more variance timers to vanilla nax  
    disable soon alert on enrage for now, it's a bit misleading to have a soon warning for something that may not actually be soon.
